            Centuries ago, the first Orcs emerged from the northern mountains of Ñuru.
            Spawned in the shadows of the deepest gorges, for years the Orcs struggled
            to survive in this dark desolate place. As time passed and the horde grew
            larger, the Orcs explored and settled in places beyond Ñuru… until that
            fateful day.
          </p>
          <p>
            On an expedition south in search of food, the Orcs encountered the Elves; a majestic, tyrannical race
            ruling over all living beings in XXXXX. The Elves slaughtered the Orcs and raided their settlements,
            casting them back to Ñuru to live in perpetual darkness.

            Traumatised and left to fend for themselves, the Orcs developed a bloodthirsty nature, killing and
            maiming anything that stood in between themselves and survival. Under the cover of the great alpine
            peaks, their skills in battle flourished. This brutish disposition became necessary to survive the harsh
            winters in a region untouched by the Sun Gods.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the years rolled on, and the nights grew darker and the winters longer, word spread of a fierce war
            raging between the Elves & the Dwarfs. With their foes preoccupied, the Orcs took it upon themselves to
            march South once more in search of more fertile lands. Hundreds of miles and thousands of dead Orcs
            later, they reached Rathmyr, a former Dwarven stronghold that had been left vacant in retreat. It was
            here the Orcs learned the science of engineering, and discovered blueprints for the mechanical vehicles
            that they would dub “Cars” - named after the Dwarven “Caryk” chariots they discovered in the mountain
            vaults.

            With their existence still largely shrouded in mystery, and the Great Elvish-Dwarf War burning on, the
            Orcs developed their engineering prowess & began to build the dwarven vehicles. Crafted using an array
            of scrap material, the results were often makeshift but allowed them to traverse the treacherous plains
            more quickly & freely.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a growing propensity for speed, the Orcs began to race against one another, offering their weapons
            and armour up as spoils for the victor. As the years went on, society developed around these races and
            crowds amassed to witness the spectacle with the prize riches they began to build a great Coliseum to
            house the events. With walls 100ft tall and a track 5 miles in diameter, they formulated the Orc Racing
            Club.

            From that day on, the O.R.C acted as a safe haven from Elf tyranny and Dwarf mischief, a place where
            Orcs could live in relative harmony, with only the odd death as a result of a disgruntled orc seeking
            revenge on their victorious counterpart. Word began to spread; from all across the 5 realms, intrigued
            observers descended upon the club to bear witness to the infamous spectacle, the bleachers as packed as
            the streets of Illnnore on the 4th day of Strymar. That was until the “Day of Death”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not much is known what happened that day, but legend has it fire rained down from the sky, as the newly
            formed Human & Elf alliance vanquished the Orcs from above, leaving the prestigious club in ruins, and
            exterminating thousands of Orcs in the process. Outnumbered and unprepared, they never stood a chance.
            The Orcs were forced to withdraw back to the Ñuru mountains. And it was here they would regroup, and
            formulate their plans for revenge…

            After decades of meticulous planning, a small horde marched upon the Elven-occupied castle of Rathmyr
            under the cover of night, the memories of that fateful day haunting their every thought. As lightning
            struck, so did they. The clash of metal echoed through Grengard only to be masked by the Elven cries of
            terror. It is said the battle raged on for 14 days and 14 nights before it was finally over. It was on
            the 14th night the Orcs would reclaim the former Dwarven stronghold; the keep their ancestors made home.

            As time passed the Horde multiplied; as news of their victory spread throughout the 5 realms, bygone
            tribes of Orc resurfaced from every cave and every hollow to join the fight. Soon the army became so
            formidable that their march could be heard throughout the 5 realms. The shaking earth from their marach
            striking fear into all who dare stand in their way, the blood curdling war cries driving even the
            bravest soul to surrender.

            Village after village was pillaged, and entire cities burned to dust as the Orcs sought to snatch power
            from the Elven Lords. Leaving no stone unturned and sparing no one, they left a trail of destruction in
            their wake. Having conquered half the territory of Grengard, they set their sights higher in a quest for
            omnipotence.
          </p>
          <p>
            They set sail for Galeserin, the great Kingdom of the Elves. It would be here that they would overthrow
            the King. It would be here they would rebuild the mighty Orc Racing Club.
